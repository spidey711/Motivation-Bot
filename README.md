# Motivation-Bot

1) Made purely with python.
2) Used Uptime Robot for hosting the bot.

3) Used Repl.it for the coding portion of this bot.

4) Make sure you have all modules/libraries installed required for this to work.
5) "main.py" is the main file for the bot and includes all functions and commands.
6) "keep_alive.py" is the server file for the bot.
7) Make sure you have added the bot on Uptime Robot, as the file "keep_alive.py" will work only then. 

NOTE : For security reasons, I have hidden the .env file which contains the token of the bot, and it is not supposed to be shared with anyone. Just be sure to add your bot's token
in the .env file and it will work.
You can also make changes to the code << after downloading >> it according to your needs i.e. increase functionality or just mess around

That is pretty much all you need to know.
